# **Project 4: A monte carlo simulation of the stars of the galaxy**
The purpose of this project is to describe the evolution of various stars according to the Chabrier (2005) initial mass function (IMF), using a Monte Carlo statistical model.
To this end, histograms were generated to describe the distribution of stars after being sampled from the IMF. Subsequently, based on the results obtained, stellar evolution was simulated to analyze their behavior, determine how many of these stars remained on the Main Sequence (MS), and, in those cases where they left it, identify the type of object they evolved into depending on their mass.
The project contains the following files and folders:
- **Proyecto_4_MC:.ipynb: ** Code used to generate all the plots.
- **Docs: ** Documents containing the necessary information to construct the distributions and define the IMF.
- **Plots: **All the graphs obtained.
